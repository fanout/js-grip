## [Unreleased]

## [Planned for 3.0.0]
- Major update with great improvements in usability, with support for modern
  language features such as `class` and `async`/`await`.  Collapses js-pubcontrol into
  js-grip, simplifying use and deployment.


### To be Added
- To add Typescript annotations for IDE completion and static type checking.

### To be Changed
### To be Removed

## [2.0.0-beta.0] - 2020-01-13
### Added
- Added ESM build. Uses Rollup (https://rollupjs.org/) to build bundles for consumption as
  CommonJS, ESM, and the Browser.
- Added new simple NodeJS based demo, providing a server and a publisher, designed
  to be used with pushpin (https://pushpin.org).
- Added a shimmed `Buffer` object to browser build, as it is needed during JWT authorization.
- IDE metadata for IntelliJ IDEA.  

### Changed
- Repository now called `js-grip` to reflect that this is useful in all types of JavaScript,
  including the browser.
- Now distributed as a public scoped package `@fanouio/grip`.
- Source files and tests rewritten in modern style JavaScript
- Source files moved from `/lib` to `/src`
- Basic data structures now using ES6 classes.
- Start using "changelog" over "change log" since it's the common usage.
- Bump major version to 2 to indicate that this is a modernized new version.
- Improved README by being more straightforward with the basic use case.
- `GripPubControl` now directory inherits from `PubControl`. 
- `GripPubControl.publish` API has been changed, and the callback is now optional.
  If no callback is provided, a Promise is returned instead.
